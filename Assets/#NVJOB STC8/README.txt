#NVJOB STC8

This is a shader for SpeedTree version 8.x for Unity. 
The shader has advanced settings compared to the standard Unity shader for SpeedTree. 
The shader fully functions in Forward Rendering and Deferred Rendering (including Subsurface Emission). 
Shaders have great scalability. The shader allows you to increase performance, but to the detriment of appearance, or to get a better image, but to the detriment of performance.
Using this shader, you can adjust the wind (speed, amplitude, swaying branches, etc.). 
The wind settings in the shader, allow you to fix incorrectly configured wind settings in SpeedTree, as well as synchronize and adjust the wind for all vegetation separately. 
You can adjust the wind parameters for each vegetation individually.

Features:
- Full wind setting.
- Advanced settings for visualization of vegetation.
- Support for all functions in Forward Rendering and Deferred Rendering.
- Good performance.

For Unity version of at least 2019.1.8 (64-bit)
Current version 3.2
